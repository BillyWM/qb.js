This is a mirror of Steve Hanov's QBASIC implementation in JavaScript.

You can read Steve's blog post about the library at [stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=92](http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=92).

Steve's code is licensed GPL v3, and I'm hosting it here so I can more easily fiddle with it.

Steve, if you ever want ownership of this GitHub repo, let me know and I'll transfer to you.
